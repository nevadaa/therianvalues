# Translating

Currently, the main way of contributing to *LeftValues* is through translating from English into other languages. Translations are handled over the [**WebLate**](https://l10n.dmnd.sh/engage/leftvalues/) application, with the process being quite simple.

## Getting Started

To begin working on translating with WebLate, you will need to create an account linked to your GitHub account. From there, you'll be able to see a list of currently translated languages as well as incomplete lines.

Translating then becomes as simple as entering a translation for each respective untranslated line. Additionally, some translations might have inaccuracies, which you may fix. Please make sure to save after completing a new translation or a translation fix.

Additionally, if there is a language that has not yet been translated, it is possible to create a new translation. Please note that, to avoid vandalization, all translations will need to be reviewed by an administrator.

If you have any further questions about how to contribute, please make an issue on the GitHub page.

    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_whatis">What is TherianValues?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_answer">TherianValues is a quiz for alterhumans, nonhumans and otherkin inspired by and based upon the <a
            href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> quiz that seeks to identify your philosophical views and identity within
        therianity. If you are not alterhuman in any way, this quiz is obviously not suited for you. You will be presented with a
        statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to
        <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. The questions for each axes are
        presented in order, rather than scattered. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum
        possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_whatvalues">What are the values?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_sixaxes">There are currently five axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_spi_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#D8FFB8;">Spiritual</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#CC86EF;">Secular</b><br />
        Those with a higher Spiritual score believe that therianity originates from spiritual and metaphysical origins,
        like reincarnation and phantom limbs. Those with a higher Secular score tend to favor a more materialist outlook,
        looking more towards the psychological and physical reasons for therianity.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_ideal_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#073972;">Ideal</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#E2BC00;">Morphological</b><br />
        Those with a higher Ideal score tend to believe in therian identity and alterhumanity as an internal affair,
        de-emphasizing morphological freedom and instead viewing therianity through more romantic lens. Those with
        a high Morphological score tend to support absolute freedom of form to any that wish for it.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_cent_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#8C175B;">Inhuman</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#597BC2;">Alterhuman</b><br />
        Those with a higher Inhuman score tend to see themselves as completely divorced from humanity, often
        identifying with eldritch creatures. Those with a higher Alterhuman score see their therianity as an extension of
        their humanity, and the two not being necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_int_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#0BA100;">Rewilding</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#8800FF;">Synthesis</b><br />
        Those with a higher Rewilding score tend to look towards nonhuman lifestyles and how to best
        create contact with non-human ecological environments. Those with a higher Synthesis score tend to prefer
        technological progress and advancements in science to realize therianity.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_party_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#00F7FF;">Assimilation</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#FF0800;">Liberation</b><br />
        Those with a higher Assimilation score tend to prefer bringing therians, alterhumans and nonhumans to wider society,
        creating advocacy groups or associations. Those with a higher Liberation score prefer a divorce from human society,
        seeking to perhaps create autonomous communes or societies without involvement of humans.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_scores">I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_scores">Please remember that you are not intended to get a 100% score in any of the
        categories. The point of the quiz is to challenge your views. If you have any suggestions or constructive
        criticism please let us know via the GitHub page.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_tracked">Am I being tracked?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_tracked">TherianValues does utilize very basic tracking to get an idea of the amount of visitors.
        No personal information is collected and answers/results are not saved. The code is sourced from other Values github tests.</p>
